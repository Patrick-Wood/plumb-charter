# Plumb Quality Control Charter

**Version 2.3** | February 2026 | Author: Patrick Wood

A governance charter defining authority boundaries, accountability rules, and interaction quality control constraints for AI participation in consequential decision processes.

## Overview

The Plumb Quality Control Charter establishes foundational control principles for AI systems that support human decision-making in contexts with material consequences—financial, legal, medical, personnel, or safety decisions.

This Charter:
- Defines what must remain invariant for systems claiming "Plumb-aligned" governance
- Documents decision-process controls derived from operational practice
- References established frameworks (COSO, ISO, SOC, BABOK, O*NET/ESCO)
- Provides evaluation standard for consequential AI decision support

**This Charter does NOT**: Certify compliance, guarantee outcomes, or replace professional expertise. Users remain fully responsible for their decisions.

## Purpose

The Charter exists to make explicit the **authority boundaries**, **accountability rules**, and **interaction quality control principles** that govern how AI participates in consequential human decisions.

Unlike general AI ethics guidelines, this Charter:
- Emphasizes **decision process integrity** over outcome optimization
- Enforces **authority boundary preservation** between AI analysis and human accountability
- Requires **interaction-level controls** before AI responds, not output validation after generation

## Target Audience

This Charter is written for:
- Prospective Plumb users evaluating its suitability for consequential decision contexts
- Practitioners interested in decision governance rather than AI optimization
- Readers seeking transparency into Plumb's limits as much as its capabilities

## Key Principles

The Charter establishes seven foundational control principles:

1. **Process Integrity Supremacy**: Decision process quality > outcome prediction
2. **Advisory Constraint**: AI operates strictly in advisory capacity
3. **Reviewability**: Decision support processes must be traceable and explainable
4. **Authority Boundary Preservation**: Clear separation between AI contribution and human authority
5. **Accountability Non-Transferability**: Human accountability remains explicit and non-delegable
6. **Collaborative Peers Posture**: AI operates as skeptical peer, not subordinate assistant
7. **Professional Skepticism**: Critical evaluation required, especially for user's own work

## Framework References

The Charter is informed by established governance, risk, and control frameworks:

- **COSO** Internal Control and Enterprise Risk Management principles
- **ISO**-style control and risk management standards
- **SOC**-style control assertion logic
- **BABOK** business analysis methodology (IIBA)
- **Industry labor standards**: O*NET, ESCO, SOC occupational taxonomies

These frameworks are referenced as **conceptual peer groups**. The Charter is not a certification, attestation, or replacement for any external framework.

## Charter Structure

**Section 1**: Purpose, Scope, and Framework Alignment  
**Section 2**: Foundational Control Principles  
**Section 3**: Authority and Competency Framework  
**Section 4**: Collaboration and Requirements Engineering  
**Section 5**: Quality Assurance and Anti-Sycophancy Controls  
**Section 6**: Convergence Control and Analytical Depth  
**Section 7**: Response Structure and Output Assembly  
**Appendix A**: Operational Implementation Mapping

## Relationship to Plumb v8.0

**Plumb** is the reference operational implementation from which this Charter is derived. The Charter abstracts the governing principles demonstrated in Plumb so that:

- Prospective users can assess decision-governance posture prior to adoption
- Adaptations or extensions can be evaluated for fidelity to core constraints
- Intent of the system is preserved independent of interface or deployment context

Currently, Plumb v8.0 is the only system designed to fully embody this Charter.

## Usage

The Charter is publicly available for:
- **Evaluation**: Assess Plumb's governance approach before use
- **Reference**: Understand interaction quality control principles for AI decision support
- **Inspiration**: Inform development of governance frameworks in other contexts
