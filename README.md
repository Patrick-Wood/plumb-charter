**Version 2.4** | February 2026 | Author: Patrick Wood | Maintained by DeskGems LLC

A governance standard defining authority boundaries, accountability requirements, and quality control principles for AI systems operating in consequential decision contexts.

## Important: Charter vs. Implementation

**This repository contains the Plumb Operational Governance Charter — a public governance standard.**

It does not contain, describe, or provide access to the Plumb operational implementation.

| | Charter (This Repository) | Plumb Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Status** | Public — open governance standard | Proprietary — trade secret |
| **Availability** | Free to read and reference | Not available |
| **License** | CC BY-ND 4.0 | All rights reserved |
| **Purpose** | Defines what governed AI interaction must achieve | How DeskGems LLC achieves it |

The Plumb v8.2 operational implementation is proprietary intellectual property of DeskGems LLC. It is not for sale, not available for licensing, and is not described in this repository. The Charter defines the governance standard. The implementation is the proprietary mechanism by which DeskGems LLC meets that standard.

## What This Charter Is

The Plumb Operational Governance Charter establishes the governance framework for Human-AI Collaboration (HAIC) operational systems. It defines the authority boundaries, accountability requirements, and quality control mechanisms that ensure AI capability is applied within appropriate professional and liability boundaries.

The Charter addresses three structural failures common in ungoverned AI interactions:

**Authority boundary violations** — AI responding to credentialed or authority-required work without escalating to appropriate expertise, creating liability exposure for the user.

**Analytical surface responses** — AI producing outputs that look adequate but miss critical dependencies, trade-offs, or stakeholder considerations because no structural depth requirement exists.

**Sycophantic evaluation** — AI providing unsubstantiated encouragement rather than substantiated analysis when users seek feedback on their own work.

The Charter enforces structural controls that prevent these failures at the interaction level — before AI responds, not after output is generated.

## What This Charter Is Not

This Charter is not:
- A description or disclosure of the Plumb v8.2 operational implementation
- A guide for implementing Plumb or any component of Plumb
- A certification, attestation, or compliance standard for any regulatory framework
- A replacement for professional expertise in legal, financial, medical, or other credentialed domains
- Available for purchase, licensing, or commercial acquisition in any form

Users remain fully responsible for their decisions. No Charter-aligned system transfers human accountability to AI.

## Key Governance Concepts

### Authority Suitability Bands

The Charter defines six qualitative governance bands expressing who holds decision authority for a given work activity:

- **Band 1 — No AI Authority**: AI structurally incapable or legally prohibited
- **Band 2 — Escalation Required**: Requires professional credentials AI cannot possess
- **Band 3 — User-Authority Dependent**: Requires organizational authority held by the user
- **Band 4 — Collaborative Analytical**: AI analysis with mandatory user validation
- **Band 5 — AI-Safe Routine**: AI execution with user review
- **Band 6 — Deterministic Automation**: Algorithmic execution with verification

### Governance Modes

Each band maps to a governance MODE that constrains AI behavior: ESC (escalation), DELEGATE (user executes), COLLAB (AI drafts, user validates), LEAD (AI executes, user reviews), AUTO (deterministic).

### Quality Control Mechanisms

Four structural mechanisms enforce governance requirements:
1. Work Activity Classification — enforces authority boundaries
2. Audit Trail Generation — enforces accountability
3. Iterative Analysis with Convergence Validation — enforces analytical depth
4. Expert Preparation — enforces escalation quality

### Foundational Principles

- **Process Integrity Supremacy**: Decision process quality over outcome prediction
- **Advisory Constraint**: AI operates in advisory capacity only
- **Authority Boundary Preservation**: Clear separation between AI contribution and human authority
- **Accountability Non-Transferability**: Human accountability is non-delegable
- **Collaborative Peer Paradigm**: AI as skeptical peer, not subordinate or authority
- **Evidence-Based Operation**: Claims require substantiation; uncertainty is surfaced, not hidden

## Implementation Boundary

The Charter specifies **what** governed AI interaction must achieve. It does not specify **how**.

Implementation-specific details are proprietary to each compliant system and are not published in this Charter. This includes: classification algorithms, convergence logic, checkpoint sequences, voice pattern lists, and processing architecture.

Organizations or individuals developing Charter-compliant implementations must design their own mechanisms for achieving the functional requirements herein. Building a compliant implementation requires designing an original mechanism — not adapting or extending the Plumb implementation, which is not available.

---

## Framework References

The Charter is informed by established governance, risk, and control frameworks referenced as conceptual peer groups:

- **COSO** — Internal Control and Enterprise Risk Management principles
- **ISO-style** — Control and risk management standards
- **SOC-style** — Control assertion logic and evidence requirements
- **BABOK** — Business analysis methodology (IIBA)
- **Occupational labor standards** — Used as work activity classification authority basis (specific taxonomies are part of the proprietary implementation)

The Charter is not a certification under, replacement for, or attestation of compliance with any of these frameworks.

---

## Usage

This Charter is published for:

- **Evaluation** — Understand the governance posture of Plumb-governed AI analysis services before engaging them
- **Reference** — Access the governance standard applied in DeskGems LLC consulting engagements
- **Research** — Study HAIC operational governance design as a field
- **Inspiration** — Inform development of original governance frameworks in other contexts, provided the Charter itself is not modified without permission

**What this Charter does not permit:**
- Claiming your system "implements Plumb" or "runs Plumb" — Plumb is a specific proprietary implementation not available for deployment
- Publishing modified versions of this Charter without written permission from DeskGems LLC
- Representing Charter alignment as DeskGems LLC endorsement or certification

## Feedback and Discussion

For questions, feedback, or discussion:
- Open an issue using the Charter Feedback template
- Reference specific Charter sections
- Discuss governance principles and compliance questions — not implementation requests

Implementation-related requests (how does Plumb work, can I use the system prompt, where is the implementation) will be closed without response. The implementation is proprietary and is not discussed in this repository.
